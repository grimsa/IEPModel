			<xs:documentation>A Distribution System describes the mechanical systems and equipment that transport air, water or another fluid. It consists of two components: Prime Mover (pump or fan) and Segment.

A Distribution System (optionally) consists of one or many Prime Movers, which is a pump or fan that causes the fluid to flow.  The Prime Mover has System and Equipment properties.

A Distribution System (optionally) consists of one or many Segments, which is a duct or pipe that transports the fluid.  The Segment has Equipment properties in addition to leakage and insulation properties (referenced from the Building schema).

The Distribution Systems was chosen to stand alone because of how the other systems interact with it and because on distribution system may serve multiple purposes.  It is be referenced by other systems such as an HVAC or WaterHeating system that interact with it.

A Distribution System (particularly air or water) may be referenced by an HVAC system in one of three ways.  A Distribution System may be referenced as the method of delivery of conditioning from the HVAC system (i.e. the ducting or piping that delivers conditioning).  Alternatively, a Distribution System may be referenced as the source of heat or cold (fluid to reject heat to) for a Heating or Cooling system, respectively.

Note that the Distribution System itself does not instance System Properties.  A distribution system can only consume energy through its prime mover and thermal transfer. The Prime Mover object instances System Properties. Thermal transfer to or from the fluid through its segments will affect the system(s) that are connected to (reference) it (such as a Hot Water Heating or HVAC system).  Thus, the thermal energy transferred through the segment surface should be captured by the zone in which the segment is located and the systems that reference it.

Example 1. A water DistributionSystem may serve both space heating as well as domestic hot water for kitchen and bathroom fixtures (i.e. dishwasher, shower). Systems that may reference this DistributionSystem include: a WaterHeating system, a grey-water HeatRecovery system and an HVACSystem.

Example 2
An air DistributionSystem may consist of supply and return ducting and a supply fan.  An HVACSystem such as a furnace or air-source heat-pump would reference the DistributionSystem (through its DeliveryMethod element).  

Example 3
A Whole house fan would be modeled as an HVAC system with a DeliveryMethod that references a Distribution System.  The Distribution System may include segments (inlet and exhaust ducting) and a fan (Prime Mover). The Ventilation properties in HVAC would further describe the rate of air exchange with outside.  The zone(s) referencing the HVAC system would specify the temperature setpoint schedule and any additional thermal loads.  

Alternatively, if the fan is controlled by a time schedule, rather than temperature schedule, the schedule may defined in the Prime Mover system properties.  Then, no HVAC system needs to be defined.

Example 4
A bathroom or kitchen exhaust fan may be modeled as a Distribution System with just a Prime Mover (segments optional).  The schedule in the System Properties of the Primer Mover may define the operating schedule of the fan.
