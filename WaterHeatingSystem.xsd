Examples:
Electric Resistance
Fuel - Condensing
Fuel - Non-Condensing
Heat Pump – Air Source
Heat Pump – Water Source
Hybrid
Heat Exchanger
Solar

Note, that some of the examples above require additional objects to be defined. For example:

- If the heating type is Heat Exchanger, a reference to a distribution system that is the heat source is needed.

- If solar, then additional details regarding the solar heating system are needed. This may simply be a reference to the distribution system that transfers heat from the solar panels to the water heating system. It may be an instance of Equipment Properties.</xs:documentation>

			<xs:element name="TankVolume" type="volume" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="1">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>This element indicates the volume of water that the tank associated with the water-heating system can hold. If there is no tank, then this should have the value zero. Water heating systems wtih zero volume (no) tanks are commonly referred to as:
- tankless
- direct 
- instantaneous
- boiler (typical in a large facility; used for space heating)

Note that a hot water tank is not necessarily and does not have to be integrated with the water heating equipment. The water heater and the storage tank may be separate entities.</xs:documentation>

				type="xs:IDREF">
				<xs:annotation>
					<xs:documentation>This is an optional reference to the distribution system, which is the source of heat.

This is particularly relevant if the heating method is a heat exchanger. For example, a facility may use hot water at multiple temperatures. One boiler may heat water to 180 degF to use for space heating. A heat exchanger may be used to extract heat from the 180degF water loop and heat another water loop to only 120 degF to be used as domestic hot water.

Another use case is when multiple water heaters are used in series. The first heaters may heat water to 130 degF for one purpose, such as domestic hot water. Another heater may boost the water to a higher temperature for another use such as laundry or dish washing.

Multiple hot water loops are often advantageous when the end uses are very far apart. The less distance that the hotter water has to travel, the less heat that will lost through the piping into the environment. It is then advantageous to boost the water temperature nearby the end use.</xs:documentation>

This "capacity" is commonly used with domestic tankless (instantaneous) water heaters.

Systems in the U.S. are often rated in a maximum gpm (flow rate) with a 35 degree Fahrenheit temperature rise. Detailed manufacturer specifications often also list the temperature rise at various flow rates.</xs:documentation>
